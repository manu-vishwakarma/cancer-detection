<h2>1.3. Real-world/Business objectives and constraints.</h2>

* No low-latency requirement.
* Interpretability is important.
* Errors can be very costly.
* Probability of a data-point belonging to each class is needed.

<h1>2. Machine Learning Problem Formulation</h1>

<h2>2.1. Data</h2>

<h3>2.1.1. Data Overview</h3>

- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/data
- We have two data files: one conatins the information about the genetic mutations and the other contains the clinical evidence (text) that  human experts/pathologists use to classify the genetic mutations. 
- Both these data files are have a common column called ID
- <p> 
    Data file's information:
    <ul> 
        <li>
        training_variants (ID , Gene, Variations, Class)
        </li>
        <li>
        training_text (ID, Text)
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>2.2. Mapping the real-world problem to an ML problem</h2>

<h3>2.2.1. Type of Machine Learning Problem</h3>

<p>
   There are nine different classes a genetic mutation can be classified into => Multi class classification problem.
</p>

<h3>2.2.2. Performance Metric</h3>

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment#evaluation

Metric(s): 
* Multi class log-loss 
* Confusion matrix 


<h3>2.2.3. Machine Learing Objectives and Constraints</h3>

<p> Objective: Predict the probability of each data-point belonging to each of the nine classes.
</p>
<p> Constraints:
</p>
 * Interpretability
 * Class probabilities are needed.
 * Penalize the errors in class probabilites => Metric is Log-loss.
 * No Latency constraints.
